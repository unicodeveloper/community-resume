These curriculums are currently been used in Nigeria and Kenya.\r\n\r\nI also actively train and mentor these fellows(Nigeria and Kenya) in the art of crafting solid, well-tested & user-friendly software.\r\n\r\nI have over 4 years of experience working with PHP and Javascript and about 2 years experience working with Java on Biometric Software Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reason for applying\r\nI struggled a lot during my initial days of learning to become a developer. Honestly, the books and videos were there and easy to get from the internet but there was really no developer community in Nigeria. Overtime, I have discovered that there is nothing greater than community driven efforts in building products and providing easy entry for talented people to join the limited pool of developers and technologists currently available.\r\n\r\nI am very passionate about programming, building products(open-source and proprietary software) specifically with web technologies and mentoring passionate, talented minds in becoming world-class developers and technology leaders.\r\n\r\nI want to raise more developers that are passionate about the community. Developers that will go on to become speakers, advocates, authors and thought leaders. I want to inspire developers to be more than just code monkeys, developers that will mentor and be mentored. All these are geared towards having a very vibrant developer community.\r\n\r\nAs a Google Developer Expert, I'll have more resources and tools to be able to reach out to fellows across remote parts of Africa and also around the world, providing them the opportunity to change the world by introducing them to web technologies and mentoring them alongside.\r\n\r\nAs a Google Developer Expert, I'll be a part of a community of talented developer experts and Googlers which provides me an incredible opportunity to grow in leaps and bounds as a programmer, trainer, author and developer evangelist.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relationship with Google\r\nI currently do not have any working relationship with Google in any capacity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Activity Details\r\n\r\n\r\n## BeMyApp Webinar\r\nHeld on: **11 May, 2016**\r\n\r\nWebinar Youtube Link: [Rapid Application Development With Laravel Spark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDN6yuT3_w4)\r\n\r\nAttendance: **Over 150**\r\n\r\nThis was a webinar streamed to developers over the world.
